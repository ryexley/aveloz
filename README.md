A Markdown Editor, based on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)
================================================================

## The Vision

Aveloz is (hopes to be) the markdown editor that I've always wanted, but never quite been able to find. The ultimate goal is for it to have the following features:

* Core features:
  * Markdown syntax highlighting
  * Realtime live preview
  * Export to various formats
  * Realtime auto-save
* Organizational features:
  * The ability to define "notebooks" (something like what OneNote allows you to create)
  * Notebooks should be bound to a folder on the local file system (should be configurable)
  * Can contain a hierarchy of folders and files (just like any regular ole file system)
